<h2>Hamiltonian Paths and the Icosian Game</h2>

<p>In graph theory, a <em>Hamiltonian path</em> is a path on which each node is visited only once. In a <em>Hamiltonian cycle</em> it is possible to jump from the last node of the path to the first node of the path, thus forming a cycle. Hamilton tried to market the so-called <em>Icosian Game</em> in 1856, where players should find a Hamiltonian path/cycle in the dodecahedron graph. Below you can find a single-player version of this game. Can you find either one of those?</p>
